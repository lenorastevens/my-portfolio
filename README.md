# Overview

As I am learning and developing my skills as a software engineer, I am studying different languages and development environments to get a deeper understanding of the programming world.  This project was inspired by a conversation with a software engineer who suggested I learn React and Tailwind.  I really enjoyed learning more about these two software developement tools and how they work together really well.  They made for a really fun project.

This profile app was writen in a React package that utilizes npm to build/run.  Properly setup in a development environment npm run start will get a server started that will be a local host, otherwise, it can be viewed as a fully functioning app at [Lenora Stevens Portfolio](https://lenorastevensportfolio.netlify.app/)

I chose to write a portfolio app for two reasons: I am entering my last year as a student developer and the content and format fit really well in a React Format.  

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration.  It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the software running (starting the server and navigating through the web pages) and a walkthrough of the code.}

# Web Pages

As a React app, there is only one long page.  However, that page is divided into sections and smooth scroll is used for a quick "jump" to each section. Home section is just a quick intro of the page. About is used to introduce myself and get to know me for potential employers.  Portfolio is just a few projects that can be viewed as their code or by their live website or video demo.  Experience is a fun visual way of displaying some of the languages and technology I have learned to use.  Contact is a form that can be filled out and will get loaded to an actual form server and I will get a notification of a response.

# Development Environment and Languages

# Future Work

{Make a list of things that you need to fix, improve, and add in the future.}
* I would like to add more sections. Development Environments or Certificates would be good to include.
* As I get more experience with React and Tailwind, I would like to create and add a logo, maybe incorporate animations.
* While I spent a lot of time on content, and interaction, I did not get time to learn to incorporate databases.  My arrays that I used are directly set in the relevant conponents. I would like to continue to learn and clean the code up a bit by placing those arrays in separate files.
